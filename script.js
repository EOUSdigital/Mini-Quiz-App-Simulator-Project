//TODO üìó Module 5. Logic and Control Flow - Lesson 07.04: Loops and Iteration - Mini-Quiz App Simulator Project


//TODO üìù Step 4: Mini-Quiz App Simulator Project

//* üí° What It Does:
//  A small app that:
//  ‚Ä¢ Loops through a set of multiple-choice questions
//  ‚Ä¢ Collects the user‚Äôs answers (simulated with an array)
//  ‚Ä¢ Checks answers and tallies the score
//  ‚Ä¢ Shows feedback using console output

//* ‚úÖ Concepts Practice:
//  ‚Ä¢ for loop to iterate through questions
//  ‚Ä¢ if/else and logical operators to evaluate answers
//  ‚Ä¢ Arrays and objects to structure questions
//  ‚Ä¢ Optional: while or do...while to simulate retrying incorrect answers

//* üìã Project Requirements:
//  1. Create a questions array:

const quiz2 = [
    { question: "What is 2 + 2?", answer: "4" },
    { question: "What is the capital of France?", answer: "Paris" },
    { question: "What is the color of the sky on a clear day?", answer: "blue" }
];

//  2. Simulate user input:

const userAnswers2 = ["4", "paris", "green"];

//  3. Use a for loop to check answers:
//  Loop through both arrays, compare answers, and count how many are correct.

//  4. Print final score:
//  Use console.log() to show total correct answers and detailed feedback.


//* ‚òëÔ∏è Pseudocode:

//  SET quiz as an array of objects with question and answer
//  SET userAnswers as an array of simulated responses

//  SET correctCount to 0
//  SET incorrectCount to 0

//  FOR i from 0 to quiz.length - 1 increment i
//      IF userAnswers[i].toLowerCase() === quiz[i].answer.toLowerCase()
//          PRINT "Correct answer!"
//          INCREMENT correctCount
//      ELSE
//          PRINT "Incorrect answer!"
//          INCREMENT incorrectCount

//  PRINT total correctCount and incorrectCount


//! üßÆ Solution
